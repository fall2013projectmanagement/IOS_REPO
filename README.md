IOS_REPO
========

Code for IOS
- To Run on simulator: 
 1. Go to: https://github.com/fall2013projectmanagement/IOS_REPO
 2. Click either "Clone in Desktop" or "Download Zip" in the bottom right corner
 3. Use Xcode to open the project files from the folder where you downloaded the project
 4. Set the simulator to Iphone Retina (3.5 inch) for best compatibility


Unfortunately I haven't setup everything for other users to download the app on the iphone and run on their phones
but you can set it up yourself if you have an apple developer account and an iphone ( > ios 5)
- To Run on device:
 1. You would need to create a provision profile from apple: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/ProvisioningDevelopment.html
